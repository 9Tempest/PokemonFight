Compilation:
    premake gmake
    make

Run:
    ./A3 Assets/pikachu.lua

Manual:
    trackball.hpp implements the trackball rotation routines
    Commands.hpp defines the Command Pattern
    Picker.hpp defines the Visitor Pattern for A3/Picker to traverse the nodes; it also defines the picking routines
    Assets/pikachu.lua constructs the pikachu model

Changes Of Data Structure:
    In SceneNode, added visitor pattern for A3/Picker to traverse; added rotatelocal to rotate around the object's local axis; added parent field for finding the upper joint node; added several transform matrices for resetting
